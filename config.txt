Configuration Management vs Orchestration
=========================================

Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack are all “configuration management” tools, which means they are designed to install and manage software on existing servers. CloudFormation and Terraform are “orchestration tools”, which means they are designed to provision the servers themselves, leaving the job of configuring those servers to other tools. These two categories are not mutually exclusive, as most configuration management tools can do some degree of provisioning and most orchestration tools can do some degree of configuration
